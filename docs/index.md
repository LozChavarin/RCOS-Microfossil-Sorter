## Week 2 Overview
#### February 8, 2017
This week's work has largely been focused on the Computer Vision aspect of this project. Of course an important part of this process was the creation of new training data under more controlled conditions, as well as examining the various modes available for the classification of this data.

Increasing the expected ease of this process, one of the major delinating factors between bones and stone is the average color. Provided that this classiciation difference holds true for all of our upcoming samples, aside from those which we have currently, each image can be reduced to a simple vector containing the average R, G, and B values. With the normalcy of this data (not the case were we interpreting the images directly), we can apply standard data mining techniques to this data such as SVMs, Linear Regression, etc. Our old training data could be inearly separated based on these RGB values, and we expect this to hold true for the upcoming data.

This upcoming week will include nailing down our classification strategy for future weeks, as well as starting to make some headway and decisions for the hardware aspect of this project.


## Week 1 Overview
#### February 1, 2017
This first week was largely focused on laying the foundation for this project, as a strong early foundation means time saved later on. This foundation week included the setup of our GitHub and this website, installing all of the packages to be used in this assignment on the comptuers of both team members (including the often persnickity OpenCV) and discussing some of the broader goals for the project.
