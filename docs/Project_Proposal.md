# Microfossil Concentrate Fossil Sorter
#### Olivia Lundelius and John Klingelhofer

## Overview

In paleontology, microfossil concentrate is a mixture of microfossils (typically from rodents and lizards) and gravel, with each particle being about 2 mm in size.  Microfossils can potentially serve as a source of big data for paleontologists about the locations and environments from which they were collected.  In order to study the microfossils, they must be sorted out from the gravel, which is a very time consuming process.  This project aims to build a machine that automatically sorts microfossils from concentrate, and for that machineâ€™s assembly and software to be made open source and accessible by paleontology laboratories.

## Milestone Goals
1. Consolidated computer vision program for distinguishing microfossils from gravel
Goals:
Rewrite color discrimination algorithm in Python/create new color discrimination function (in Python)
Make shape-based discrimination function
Incorporate both functions into a single discrimination program for images of individual microfossils and gravel
Stretch:
Determine minimum amount of training necessary to have 90%+ accuracy (may require acquiring multiple samples of microfossil concentrate, currently possess one sample)


2. Set of commandline tools for general users to run computer vision program on images (to be later incorporated with hardware and user interface)
Goals:
Create tool for training computer vision program with directories for microfossil/gravel images
Document usage of training
Allow for batch processing of images
Stretch:
Create ability to save/load a training profile
Create user interface


3. Design prototype of hardware sorter
Goals:
Determine most appropriate method of safely and efficiently sorting microfossils concentrate
Identify and locate where to acquire hardware necessities, such as camera, arduino, etc.
Have drawn plans of prototype sorter, including necessary electronics
Stretch:
Assemble prototype sorter and make changes to model and parts as necessary
Design and assemble second-draft prototype

4. Launch website and progress blog
Goals:
Include project and contact information
Include relevant information about potential usefulness of project

## Overarching Goals
* Documentation: Be detailed but concise in usage and workings of available and usable functions
Be written continuously and covering all important functions and general structure of program
Include less-technical side to documentation for general, non-programmer users of microfossil sorter project
* Website: Include regular updates to progress of the project. Include running to-do lists in updates for immediate future
