Program Purpose: Sort microfossils from gravel using color values, using a trained Sklearn_SVM machine learning package in python. 


Technologies: Sklearn_SVM, tested on Windows 10, PyCharm


live_demo:
runs the sorter program by intialing the camera uses trained machine learning package to sort samples. There are 2 options to run this program, one 
with the capiblity of training while running, and using strcitly a pre trained machine learning apporach. 


To run on terminal:
\live_demo.py [machine learning apporach] [camera_number] [bones photos folder path] [path to gravel photos]

\live_demo.py  [machine learning apporach] [camera_number] [weight file]
*note: weight file for pre trained machine learning

*note: camera number default is commonly 0 and all directory path in the paramters need to be absolute.

To run in PyCharm IDE:
After cloning the Microfossil sorter, and opening directory in PyCharm,
go to live_demo program configerations with the paramaters.
